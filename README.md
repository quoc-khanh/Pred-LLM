## Project Overview  

ðŸš€ **Leveraging LLMs for Financial Data Generation**  

This project explores the use of **Large Language Models (LLMs)** to generate virtual data for **finance, fraud detection, and credit scoring** datasets. By integrating **Pred-LLM**, a state-of-the-art (SOTA) model, we experiment with novel techniques and analyze their effectiveness.  

### ðŸ”¬ Key Contributions  
âœ… **Pred-LLM as the SOTA model** for synthetic data generation  
âœ… **Innovative techniques** inspired by recent research  
âœ… **Comprehensive experiments** evaluating model performance  
âœ… **Summarized findings** in the diagram below
